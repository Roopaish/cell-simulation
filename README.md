# cell-simulation
Cell simulation with respect to force of attraction between them

This program implements the force of attraction i.e. F = G * (m1 * m2) / r^2. We have 4 particles represented by red, green, cyan and orange colors. Each particle has certain force of attraction/repulsion towards another one. Like red attracts yellow, yellow repulses cyan, cyan attract yellow and likewise. This set of attraction gives rise to random patterns as can be seen here.
